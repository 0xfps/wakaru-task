1. Import of the entire interface. (I)
    -> Use specific imports.

2. Wrong implementation of generic Transfer event. (L)
    -> to, from, amount ==> from, to, amount

3. No checks for zero address in the constructor. (L)

4. Funds are transferred from contract balance, not from caller balance (C).
